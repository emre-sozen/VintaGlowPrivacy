VintaGlow Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 20.07.2025

Welcome to VintaGlow! Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how VintaGlow ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, shares, and protects your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

Please read this policy carefully. By using the VintaGlow App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

1. Information We Collect

To provide our service, we collect the following types of information:

a) Information You Provide Directly:

Photographs: The primary data we collect is the digital images ("Photos") that you voluntarily upload to the App for restoration, enhancement, and colorization. These Photos may contain personal data if they include images of identifiable people.

b) Information We Collect Automatically:

Usage Data: We may collect information about how you interact with our App, such as the features you use, the number of photos you process, and the time and date of your activity.

Device Information: We may collect information about the mobile device you use to access our App, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information. This data is typically anonymized and helps us improve compatibility and performance.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

To Provide and Maintain the Service: Our core purpose is to use your uploaded Photos to create enhanced and colorized versions. This is the primary use of your data.

To Improve Our App: We analyze usage data to understand what features are popular, to diagnose and fix technical issues, and to improve the overall user experience.

To Communicate With You: We may use your information to respond to your support requests or to send you important updates about the App (if you have opted in).

For Security and Legal Compliance: To protect the rights, property, or safety of VintaGlow, our users, and the public, and to comply with legal obligations.

3. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal information. We only share your information with third parties in the following, limited circumstances:

a) Third-Party AI Service Providers:

This is essential for our App's functionality. To perform the photo restoration and colorization, we must send your uploaded Photos to third-party artificial intelligence (AI) service providers.

What is shared: Only the Photo you upload for processing is sent.

Why it is shared: These providers have the advanced computational models necessary to perform the enhancement.

Our Commitment: We have selected our AI partners based on their commitment to privacy and security. They are contractually obligated to use your Photos only for the purpose of providing the enhancement service to you and are prohibited from using your Photos for any other purpose (such as training their own AI models without explicit consent). They are also required to delete your Photos from their systems after processing is complete.

b) Other Service Providers:
We may engage other third-party companies to perform services on our behalf, such as cloud hosting (for temporary storage) and analytics. These providers only have access to the information necessary to perform their functions and are obligated to protect your data.

c) Legal Requirements:
We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, or protect the personal safety of users of the App or the public.

4. Data Retention and Deletion

Your privacy and the security of your memories are our top priority.

Your Photos: Your original and processed Photos are stored on our servers only for the duration necessary to complete the enhancement process and deliver the final result to you. We automatically and permanently delete your Photos from our active servers within 24 hours of the processing being completed.

Other Data: Anonymized usage and device data may be retained for a longer period to help us with analytics and app improvement.

5. Security

We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use technologies like encryption to safeguard your data during transit and at rest. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

6. Children's Privacy

Our service is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or 16 in certain jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.

7. Your Rights (For Users in the EEA/UK and California)

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, including the right to access, correct, or delete your information. As we delete your photos automatically and do not require user accounts, most of these rights are addressed by our data handling practices. If you have any questions about your data, please contact us.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
